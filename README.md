Created for the Craftsmanship Academy 2026 Take Home Assignment (RoleModel Software)
First app I've made using Rails and Ruby

Add locations by inputting the IP address (recommended) or a postal address.
The postal address API is quite buggy.
Click a location on the side bar to select it, and hit it's delete button to remove it.
Currently the selected location just prints out the high and low tempiture for a 7 day period.

(Need to add current day hour tracking to make it more useful as a weather app.)
Should be able to find it currently hosted on https://weatherapp-83h1.onrender.com/ for an easy way to view it in action.
